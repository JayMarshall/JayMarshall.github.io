**GeoPackager**
GeoPackager is a simplified interface for working with and creating OGC-compliant GeoPackages in Python.

GeoPackage is a portable, platform-agnostic geospatial database built on SQLite. GeoPackager aims to offer a minimalistic interface for CRUD operations within a GeoPackage. 

Some notable features of GeoPackager:
- Built with minimal third-party libraries to ensure broad compatability.
- Easily export and transform data to JSON/GeoJSON for use in common GIS libraries and software.
- Fully open source with a non-restrictive license.

Currently GeoPackager is only compatible with vector-based data, but raster support is planned in future versions.
